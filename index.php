        An Internet meme, more commonly known simply as a meme 
        (/miÀêm/ MEEM), is an idea, behavior, image, or style that 
        is spread via the Internet, often through social media platforms. 
        What is considered a meme may vary across different communities on the 
        Internet and is subject to change over time. Traditionally, they were a concept 
        or catchphrase, but the concept has since become broader and more multi-faceted, 
        evolving to include more elaborate structures such as challenges, GIFs, videos, and viral 
        sensations.[1]
